# Selene

A fortnite lobby emulator.

## Running selene on your PC
(note: selene is currently not yet fully featured and therefore will not provide much practical use until a later release. eventually the project will probably be dockerized and include edgedb to provide a more user-friendly way of setting things up)
- Install deno from `https://deno.com/manual/getting_started/installation`
- Clone the repo.
- Run `deno run --allow-all main.ts` in the project directory.
